In this Ruby code, the PrimeTime method takes an integer num as input. It uses a loop to iterate from 2 to 10 and checks if any number in that range (excluding num) divides num without a remainder. If such a divisor is found, the method returns "false". If no divisor is found in the range, the method returns "true".

The test cases are then executed by calling PrimeTime with different inputs, and the results are printed to the console using puts.
